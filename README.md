How to host a resume on GitHub
===

Purpose
---
In this README file, you will find a guide on how to create and format an online resume using *GitHub*. The process involves using a few tools, including a markup language called *Markdown*, a text editor such as *Visual Studio*, and a static site generator called *Jekyll*. Additionally, this guide includes steps on how to host your online resume on *GitHub*, which is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). With these tools and steps, you will be able to create a professional-looking online resume that is easily accessible to potential employers.

Prerequisites
---
To create your resume, you should use a formatting language called *Markdown*. *Markdown* is easy to learn and widely used for documenting text. Andrew Etter, in his book, explains that *Markdown* has clean syntax and makes it convenient for others to contribute to your document. There are many text editors available for creating *Markdown* documents, but *Visual Studio* is a great option because it has a live preview feature that makes editing easier.

You will also need a *GitHub* account to host your static site. GitHub is a distributed version control system that allows you to store and manage your code and documents online. By using *GitHub*, you can share your work with others and collaborate with them in real-time.
